fix the file structue of the project

make a function that will increase the spin of the globe on swipe or if mouse clicked and dragged - have added inertia with swpipe - it is working but it is not stoppig with the click on the country
look at something like if country returned stop the spinning and do not restart unless a button like pick again is clicked. That button should be in the food/recipe modal

get the modal pop up working with some lorem ipsum text

When the country is displayed also display the recipe from an API, look at the one that we used for class

Get some country info from some API to use in the modal

setup the back end

set up the DB

fix the 2 diget countrys that are being prepended with a 0 - I fixed this by deploying the tsv file to its own repo and linking to it, this was do to a cors error . when back end is set up re visit as grabbing back end to front should fix this .

Country Info - this will need to be a call to Wiki using the "Country Name" , then return a hyperlink to it or even an object with some key data points.

Recipe - this will eventualy need to be a call to a recipie AIP or DB of users own recipes - for now could just return one if country matches display this recipie
